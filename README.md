# paradox

Given that I couldn't get any of the Paradox offical apps working with my panel, decided to do some reverse engineering of their web interface provided by IP150 module and built an iOS app based on the findings.
The functionality I mostly cared about was to see in which state is the alarm system and be able to arm and disarm according to the state. In settings it is possible to set credentials and ip address.
